<p>History: Started as LA County Poor Farm was built in 1888 as a catch-all institution for the Los Angeles County Medical Center;
<br>a place to care for the handicapped, homeless, insane and elderly. Later turned into Rancho Los Amigos. The hospital served as a 
<br>treatment center for TB and polio patients decades ago. Also during training in 2006 US Marines found frozen mummified brains, legs
<br>and feet. Many have recorded their experiences and have posted it on YouTube. </p>
