<h1>Independence High School</h1>
<p>San Jose, Ca</p>
<img src="sanjose.jpg" alt="Independence High School" style="width:100%;">
<p>Being one of the most haunted places in San Jose, people say that they are often visited by a ghost named George
<br> in their theater because of the events that happened during either performances or practices such as turning off 
<br> and on lights and turning over chairs. Stories say that he was a student who attended the high school but no 
<br> records show death. Other say that the theater was built over his death place so he continues to haunt the theater.
<br>He's known for being very goofy but lately has become very violent but never harming anyone. <br>
Other info about the school: In 2015 a dead body was found in the bottom of the schoolâ€™s swimming pool.</p>
